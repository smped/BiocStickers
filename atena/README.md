* Credits: The atena package image is a tribute to
  [Beatriz Calvo Serra](https://github.com/beacalvo), its main developer
  and first maintainer, who sadly passed away on January 10th, 2024. The
  image is based on a charcoal drawing from her, as she was 10 years old,
  courtesy of her family, giving a scanline style using an early version
  of the [scanline](https://github.com/cj-holmes/scanline) package. The
  image was completed by adding the sketch of two non-LTR retrotranpositions
  during priming and reverse transcription, which are associated with the
  purpose of the [atena package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/atena),
  which is the analysis and quantification of transposable element expression.
